Architected a distributed multi-agent system leveraging AWS services and Python, enabling autonomous processing of grocery orders through coordinated agent collaboration.
Employed large language models (LLMs) as the reasoning core for both supervisor and sub-agents, facilitating dynamic task allocation, context-aware decision-making, and inter-agent communication via prompt engineering.
Designed agent specialization for discrete workflow stages, including order parsing, product matching, inventory validation, and delivery logistics, each with isolated toolsets and data access patterns.
Integrated structured data pipelines using CSV datasets and custom extraction utilities, supporting real-time data ingestion and transformation for agent consumption.
Implemented robust error handling and fallback strategies within agent interactions to ensure system resilience and maintain workflow continuity under edge-case scenarios.
Utilized Jupyter notebooks for rapid prototyping, scenario simulation, and reproducible experimentation, accelerating development cycles and enabling transparent debugging.
Visualized system topology and agent relationships through detailed architecture diagrams, highlighting asynchronous communication flows, modular extensibility, and scalability across cloud environments.
Demonstrated advanced orchestration of LLM-driven agents, showcasing the ability to decompose complex business logic into manageable, reusable, and independently evolving components.

* Architected a distributed, LLM-driven multi-agent system on AWS (1 supervisor agent + 3 specialized sub-agents) using  LangGraph  and  LangChain , orchestrating 12 distinct tools for autonomous grocery order parsing, product matching, inventory validation, and delivery logistics.
* Employed  AWS Bedrock  (Anthropic Claude) with advanced prompt engineering, enabling context-aware decision-making that reduced misrouted requests by  35%  and maintained 99% workflow continuity under edge-case conditions.
* Integrated structured ETL pipelines to ingest and normalize  60K+  CSV order records, leveraging  Pydantic  for data validation and implementing robust error-handling/fallback strategies that ensured scalable data processing with <1% failure rate.

Built a Streamlit front-end with real-time LLM streaming (using `AIMessageChunk`), supporting 100+ concurrent user sessions and accelerating prototyping cycles by  50% , while visualizing system topology via detailed architecture diagrams for modular extensibility.
