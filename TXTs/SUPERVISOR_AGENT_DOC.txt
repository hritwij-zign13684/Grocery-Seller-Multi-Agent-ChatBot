SUPERVISOR_AGENT_4.PY - IN-DEPTH TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed Explanation of Imports and Libraries:

- Seperate_Agents.product_rec_agent, order_processing_agent, support_agent:
  - These are the three core sub-agents, each encapsulating a LangGraph-based workflow for a specific domain:
    - Product Recommendation: Handles product search, filtering, and retrieval.
    - Order Processing: Handles calculations for delivery, order finalization, and data persistence.
    - Support: Handles post-order management, modifications, cancellations, and external queries.

- typing, typing_extensions:
  - Provide advanced type annotations (e.g., TypedDict, Annotated, Literal) for static type checking and code clarity.

- boto3:
  - AWS SDK for Python. Used to create a Bedrock runtime client, which is required for invoking Anthropic Claude models via AWS Bedrock.

- pydantic:
  - Used for data validation and structured data models. While not directly used in this file, it is a best practice for ensuring data integrity in agent tool arguments and outputs.

- json:
  - Standard library for JSON serialization/deserialization, useful for handling structured data exchanges between agents.

- langchain_aws.ChatBedrock:
  - LangChain integration for AWS Bedrock LLMs. Provides a unified interface for invoking large language models (LLMs) hosted on AWS.

- langgraph:
  - Provides graph-based workflow management for conversational agents. Enables modular, stateful, and extensible agent design.

- langchain_core.tools.tool:
  - Decorator for defining callable tools that can be invoked by the supervisor agent. Each tool is a function that encapsulates a sub-agent's logic.

- langchain_core.messages:
  - Provides message classes (HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage, ToolMessage) for structured, role-based conversation management.

- System_Prompts.super_agent_sys_prompt_2:
  - Imports the system prompt that defines the supervisor agent's behavior, workflow, and rules. This prompt is critical for aligning the agent's responses with business requirements.

- langgraph.prebuilt.InjectedState, create_react_agent:
  - Utilities for injecting state into tool functions and for quickly building a ReAct-style agent graph, which supports tool-calling and dynamic decision-making.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent Orchestration Pattern:

- The supervisor agent follows an orchestration pattern where it acts as a router and coordinator:
  1. Receives user input and maintains conversation state.
  2. Decides which sub-agent/tool to invoke based on the request and system prompt.
  3. Formats the request as a HumanMessage and appends it to the conversation state.
  4. Invokes the relevant sub-agent with the updated state.
  5. Returns the sub-agent's response to the user.
  6. Persists conversation state using MemorySaver for continuity.

- This pattern enables separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability. Each sub-agent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Sub-Agents as Tools of the Supervisor Agent

- In this architecture, each sub-agent (product recommendation, order processing, support) is wrapped as a LangChain tool using the @tool decorator.
- These sub-agent tools are then registered in a tools list and passed to the supervisor agent.
- The supervisor agent, constructed via `create_react_agent`, can dynamically select and invoke any sub-agent as a tool based on the user's request and the system prompt's workflow logic.

# Functionality:
- When the supervisor agent receives a user input, it analyzes the request and determines which sub-agent/tool is best suited to handle the task.
- The supervisor agent formats the request and passes it to the chosen sub-agent tool, which executes its specialized workflow (e.g., product search, order calculation, support query).
- The sub-agent processes the request, possibly invoking its own internal tools, and returns a structured response to the supervisor agent.
- The supervisor agent then relays this response back to the user, maintaining the overall conversation flow and context.

# Impact:
- This design enables modularity, as each sub-agent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
- It allows for clear separation of concerns, with each sub-agent focusing on its domain expertise.
- The supervisor agent acts as a central orchestrator, ensuring that user requests are routed efficiently and handled by the most appropriate logic.
- This approach enhances scalability, as new sub-agents or tools can be added with minimal changes to the supervisor logic.
- It also improves maintainability and robustness, as issues in one sub-agent do not affect the others, and the supervisor agent can handle fallback or error scenarios gracefully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Message Handling and State Management:

- Messages are handled as structured objects (HumanMessage, ToolMessage, etc.), each with metadata such as sender, content, and unique IDs.
- The supervisor agent converts tool call arguments into HumanMessages, ensuring that sub-agents receive contextually rich and well-structured input.
- State is managed using LangGraph's StateGraph and MemorySaver, allowing for robust checkpointing and recovery.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tool Wrappers for Sub-Agents:

- Each sub-agent is wrapped as a @tool-decorated function:
  - product_recommendation_agent: Handles product search and retrieval.
  - order_processing_agent: Handles order calculations and finalization.
  - support_agent: Handles order management and external queries.
- Each tool function:
  - Extracts the latest tool call arguments from the state.
  - Wraps them as a HumanMessage from the "SUPERVISOR".
  - Invokes the corresponding sub-agent with the updated message list.
  - Returns the content of the sub-agent's response.
- Detailed docstrings describe each tool's capabilities, parameters, and expected outputs, serving as both documentation and runtime hints.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error Handling and Robustness:

- The agent design anticipates missing or malformed data by:
  - Requesting clarification only when critical data is missing.
  - Never speculating when information is unavailable.
  - Verifying all information before processing requests.
- The use of structured messages and state management reduces the risk of context loss or miscommunication between agents.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extensibility and Best Practices:

- The supervisor agent is highly extensible:
  - New tools or sub-agents can be added by defining additional @tool functions and including them in the tools list.
  - The system prompt can be updated to reflect new business rules or workflows.
  - The modular design allows for easy integration with external APIs or databases.
- Best practices followed:
  - Clear separation of concerns between supervisor and sub-agents.
  - Use of type annotations and docstrings for maintainability.
  - Structured message passing for clarity and reliability.
  - Persistent memory for long-running conversations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Prompt and Business Logic:

- The imported system prompt (s3) encodes business rules, workflow steps, and agent usage guidelines.
- It ensures that the supervisor agent:
  - Greets users, guides them through product discovery, order placement, and support.
  - Enforces rules for product IDs, pricing, and delivery.
  - Keeps internal workflow and agent details hidden from customers.
  - Maintains a professional, efficient, and helpful tone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
create_react_agent Functionality:

- The `create_react_agent` method from LangChain is a high-level utility for constructing a ReAct-style agent graph.
- It automatically builds a supervisor agent node that can reason, decide when to call tools, and manage tool execution nodes.
- The method takes an LLM, a list of tools, a system prompt, and a memory checkpointer, and returns a fully functional agent capable of dynamic tool selection and multi-step reasoning.
- This approach simplifies agent orchestration by abstracting away the manual graph construction, making it easier to implement robust, extensible, and maintainable multi-agent systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of Working Flow:

1. User sends a request (e.g., "Find me snacks under 200 INR in Mumbai").
2. Supervisor agent parses the request and, guided by the system prompt, determines the appropriate sub-agent/tool.
3. The request is formatted as a HumanMessage and appended to the conversation state.
4. The relevant sub-agent is invoked, processes the request, and returns a structured response.
5. The supervisor agent relays the response to the user, ensuring continuity and context.
6. The MemorySaver persists the conversation state for future turns.
