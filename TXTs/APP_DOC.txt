--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
This file implements the Streamlit-based user interface for the multi-agent grocery shopping assistant system. It connects the web UI to the supervisor agent, manages user sessions, and streams agent responses in real time. The design leverages Streamlit for rapid prototyping, LangChain for agent orchestration, and advanced message streaming for a responsive user experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Libraries and Their Roles:

- streamlit (st):
  - Provides the web application framework for building interactive UIs.
  - Used for rendering chat messages, handling user input, and managing session state.

- supervisor_agent_4.supervisor_agent:
  - The orchestrator agent that routes user requests to the appropriate sub-agent (product recommendation, order processing, support).
  - Handles all business logic and workflow coordination.

- langchain_core.messages.ToolMessage, AIMessageChunk:
  - ToolMessage: Represents structured responses from tool calls (e.g., sub-agents).
  - AIMessageChunk: Represents streamed chunks of AI-generated responses, enabling partial updates to the UI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Session State Management:

- st.session_state['message_history']:
  - Stores the full chat history as a list of message dictionaries (role/content).
  - Ensures that the conversation persists across Streamlit reruns.

- st.session_state['configurable']:
  - Stores configuration parameters, such as a thread ID, for agent context and reproducibility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Interface Flow:

1. The app displays a title and subtitle describing the system.
2. It initializes session state for message history and configuration if not already present.
3. It renders the full chat history using Streamlit's chat_message context manager.
4. It waits for user input via st.chat_input.
5. Upon receiving input, it appends the user's message to the session history and displays it in the chat.
6. It calls the response streaming generator to process the input and stream the agent's response in real time.
7. The assistant's response is appended to the session history for continuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response Streaming Strategy:

- The core of the response streaming logic is in the `graph_response_generator` function.
- This function:
  1. Sends the user's prompt to the supervisor agent using the `.stream()` method, which yields response tuples and metadata as the agent processes the request.
  2. Detects when the agent is about to use a tool (sub-agent) by checking for a "tool_use" type in the response content.
  3. If the response is plain text (not a tool call), it yields the text directly for immediate display.
  4. If a tool is used, it waits for a ToolMessage with status "success", then streams the subsequent AIMessageChunk(s) containing the final response.
  5. This approach allows the UI to update in real time as the agent reasons, calls tools, and generates output, providing a highly responsive user experience.
- The function is robust to different response types and ensures that only relevant text is streamed to the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error Handling and Robustness:

- The generator function is designed to handle various response structures, including lists of content and different message types.
- It avoids yielding empty or irrelevant content, ensuring a clean user experience.
- The session state ensures that the chat history is never lost, even if the Streamlit app reruns due to code changes or user actions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extensibility and Best Practices:

- The app is modular: swapping out the supervisor agent or adding new configuration options is straightforward.
- The use of session state and message history enables multi-turn, context-aware conversations.
- The response streaming pattern can be extended to support richer UI elements (e.g., tables, images) as needed.
- The code includes commented-out alternative implementations for response streaming, showing flexibility in design.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of Working Flow:

1. User enters a prompt in the chat input.
2. The prompt is added to the session history and displayed.
3. The supervisor agent processes the prompt, possibly invoking sub-agents/tools.
4. The response is streamed back to the UI in real time, updating as the agent reasons and completes tool calls.
5. The final response is appended to the session history, maintaining full conversational context.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:

app.py serves as the interactive front end for the multi-agent grocery shopping assistant, combining Streamlit's rapid UI capabilities with advanced agent orchestration and real-time response streaming. It delivers a seamless, responsive, and context-aware user experience, supporting complex multi-turn interactions with the underlying AI agents.
